### Does the Use of Pre-made Digital Flashcards Aid in Medical Students Learning of Anatomy

Important notes:
- Anki was helpful to 82% of participants
- **Card decks produced by the school for the specific curriculum found to be significantly more helpful then using third party decks created on same topic**

>This study was aiming to determine if any benefits exist in providing MS1s with premade _Anki_ cards based off of their medical school’s curriculum. Almost all (80%) of survey respondents found the MS2-made _Anki_ cards helpful in their studies. This is likely due to the confidence that the flashcards were made based on their school’s curriculum and were made by students who had previously completed the course. This is supported by the observation that students who used 3rd party decks had higher test anxiety than those who did not. This may be due to the fact that 3rd party flashcards do not align well with an individual medical school’s curriculum, resulting in students feeling unsure if they are studying the right material for their exams. Limitations included a small sample size and low survey response rate, especially for students who did not use anki.


### Enhanced Learning and Retention of Medical Knowledge Using the Mobile Flash card Application Anki

Important Notes:
- showed increase in test scores for anki participants
- suggests better learning retention for anki users
- shows premade third party decks more popular then making their own

>Although 57.4% of respondents used lecture material to create Anki flash cards, at least 80% of participants used a variety of pre-made Anki flash card decks that are available to download online. These flash card decks included Zanki Step Decks (72.7%), Zanki Pharmacology (57.6%), Lolnotacop (21.2%), Pepper Micro (63.6%), and Light Year (21.2%). These pre-made flash card decks have been created from popular study resources such as First Aid and Pathoma (Zanki Step Decks), Sketchy Pharmacology and Microbiology (Zanki Pharmacology, Lolnotacop and Pepper Micro), and Boards and Beyond (Light Year).

>A prevailing strategy for effective memorization and testing preparation in recent years is the "spaced-repetition" method, epitomized by the Anki study system.19 A key benefit of using Large Language Models (LLMs) lies in their ability to automate the labor-intensive process of creating Anki flashcards, thereby freeing up students to engage in the deeper work of analysis and practicing for examinations.20 Students can instruct the LLM to generate Anki flashcards from specific portions of their coursework. They can then utilize another prompt to convert these flashcards into an Excel table format. This format is readily importable into any preferred Anki application, facilitating a seamless integration of the AI-enhanced study materials with the students' existing study system. This application of AI technology significantly streamlines the study process, shifting the focus from the manual labor of creating study materials to the more intellectually stimulating tasks of analyzing legal principles and practicing application of law. The incorporation of AI into the Anki method represents a promising innovation in legal education study methodologies, holding potential to significantly enhance study efficiency and testing performance.

>Using the method described above, we selected flashcards from the AnKing flashcard deck that contained 35,152 flashcards and tagged them to our institution’s preclinical curriculum (Figure 2) [8]. We obtained a total of 465 science of medicine lecture guides spanning the 15 system-based modules at Feinberg School of Medicine for the 2022-2023 academic year. For each lecture guide, an average of 13 (range 5-34) summary learning questions were generated by our algorithm. For example, a lecture on central nervous system cancers, might include the following questions: “How do we diagnose and treat gliomas?” and “What genetic syndromes are associated with benign and malignant tumors in the brain?” After generating 4918 unique learning questions, the selection algorithm yielded a total of 21,400 flashcards from the AnKing deck, of which 16,113 were designated as highly relevant to a learning question. On average, 88 (range 11-221) flashcards were selected per lecture. Upon inspection of a sample of lectures, the quality of selections was considered high, with >90% of cards appearing highly relevant. The process developed is highly scalable, with individual lecture guides processed in minutes at minimal computational cost.

>As large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT series continue to make strides, we witness the emergence of artificial intelligence applications in an ever-expanding range of fields. In medicine, these LLMs hold considerable promise for improving medical workflows, diagnostics, patient care, and education. Yet, there is an urgent need for open-source models that can be deployed on-premises to safeguard patient privacy. In our work, we present an innovative dataset consisting of over 160,000 entries, specifically crafted to fine-tune LLMs for effective medical applications. We investigate the impact of fine-tuning these datasets on publicly accessible pre-trained LLMs, and subsequently, we juxtapose the performance of pre-trained-only models against the fine-tuned models concerning the examinations that future medical doctors must pass to achieve certification.

## Student-directed retrieval practice is a predictor of medical licensing examination performance

107 citations

### Results

>All students reported using practice MCQs (mean 3870, SD 1472). Anki and Firecracker users comprised 31 and 49 % of respondents, respectively. In a multivariate regression model, significant independent predictors of Step 1 score included MCQs completed (unstandardized beta coefficient [B] = 2.2 × 10− 3, _p_ < 0.001), unique Anki flashcards seen (B = 5.9 × 10− 4, _p_ = 0.024), second-year honours (B = 1.198, _p_ = 0.002), and MCAT score (B = 1.078, _p_ = 0.003). Test anxiety was a significant negative predictor (B= − 1.986, _p_ < 0.001). Unique Firecracker flashcards seen did not predict Step 1 score. Each additional 445 boards-style practice questions or 1700 unique Anki flashcards was associated with an additional point on Step 1 when controlling for other academic and psychological factors.

### Conclusions

>Medical students engage extensively in self-initiated retrieval practice, often with spaced repetition. These practices are associated with superior performance on a medical licensing examination and should be considered for formal support by educators.
