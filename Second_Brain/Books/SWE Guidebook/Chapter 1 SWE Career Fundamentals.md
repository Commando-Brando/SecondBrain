## Key Take Aways:

1. Own your own career - set goals, share your work/success, and try to get feedback
2. Be seen as someone who gets things done - when you make impact try to measure the business impact and share it
3. Keep a work log - record key work each week including important code changes, code reviews, design documents, discussion, planning, helping out others, postmortems, and anything else which takes time and has impact.
4. Understand the team's/manager's goals - ask them what are the biggest challenges the team/manager are facing in the coming weeks/months - there may be opportunities for you to help
5. Figure out what is important to your team, what is rewarded? How is impact measured?
6. Ask manager/tenured teammates about teams goals & how they align with the company's goals
7. Ask key-role people with influence about the team's/company's goals - could be product manager, skip manager, or business stakeholders
8. Figure out how performance reviews work and how to get the most out of them, ask mentors about it maxing it
9. In addition to work logs, record your wins - if you successful complete something record it and also screenshot positive feedback related to it
10. Share your progress from worklogs/wins to your manager in 1:1s because they often do not hear all the work you do
11. Help others, do code reviews, pair programming, or help unblock people when you have power to do so - make a teams calendar event to help capture you helping other or capture messages
12. Ask for feedback a good amount of time before performance reviews so you have time to improve on any area you are lacking
13. Ask for feedback about how you did and how you can improve for the following events: facilitating meeting, leading project, reviewing code (too harsh or not specific), resolving an outage, proposing a new initiative
14. Interact with others outside your team, whether it be data scientists, product managers, etc... 
15. Be interested in all aspects of your product
16. Talk to people who use your product, if you're a platform team connect with the engineers who use it, be welcoming to answer questions given by them 
17. Figure out if my team/company is a ship fast decent quality vs ship slower high quality
18. For the first 3 months keep a learning journal, write down 3 things you learn and 3 things you do not know but want to learn each week
19. Make Anki deck for all things you learn at msft
20. Learn from your manager what big projects your team is working on, what the priority level of each is to the team's/company's success
21. Do not take code review comments personally
22. Read as much code as you write - lots of code reviews, it can be good to review code on a sister team or on a internal technology our team uses, or open source projects 
23. Create a cheatsheet for company internal tools, and useful links for docs you can reference
24. Create a cheatsheet for common classes/modules your team uses or works with and write descriptions so you can reference them in the future
25. Learn to debug the CI/CD 
26. Learn and understand production logs/dashboards
27. When you ask for feedback try to make sure it is actionable if someone says something vague ask for clarification so you can take action to improve on it
28. Be detailed but concise when reporting on your work and the challenges you faced and how you overcame them
29. Block time to do deep work kind of as a high priority meeting so you do not get distracted but avoid overdoing it
30. Read the [Google Code Review Guide](https://slab.com/library/examples/google-code-review/)

## Getting stuff done
1. There are a lot of things you can work on always know what your #1 priority is and make sure it gets delivered on time even if you have to delay other things
2. Learn to say no to make sure you #1 priority gets done, but say no in a way like this: "yes I would like to help BUT x"
3. If you need help resolving blockers check out the cheatsheet on pafe 98
4. Try to break a task/project into as many sub-tasks as possible without getting too granular at the coding level - prioritize the sub tasks which will get stuff shipped quick so you can quickly test your project end to end and find out if you're on the right track


## Promotion
- must show impact of work so seek high impact tasks
- learn how promotions work and what are the requirements
- who are the parties that decide whether you get promoted
- "Its not enough to do good work, you need to work with other and publish your work so other are aware of it"
- Try to set goals with your manager and get it in writing so you can follow up with them later
- If you start chasing promotion let other know you are trying to get promoted
- Do not over focus on getting promoted tot he point that everyone thinks youre only self-interested

# Programming 

## Language Proficiency
- learn everything deeply
- learn best practices and understand why they are best
- go under the hood and learn how memory management, garbage collection, code compilation, and what matters for performance
- learn more advanced parts of language like generics, parallel execution/threading, and additional language features
- additional questions on page 122

## Debugging
- Learn your IDE's debugger and know it well
- Pair/shadow everyone on your team at least once to try to get insights in how other debug and maybe see some features you are not aware of or uses of known features

## Refactoring
- Refactoring is important and a separate skill on its own, keep an eye out on possible places for refactor and do them in the future and make a list of them, a refactor backlog
- don't refactor without consulting teammates about possible refactor areas
- Learn your IDE's refactoring capabilities

## Software Tools
- learn more advanced git, rebasing, cherry pick


## Senior Engineer Goals
- Short iterations - break problems down into small chunks so you can ship to prod everyday
- Be an unblocker - grow a network with other teams and workers in the company you can leverage to help unblock yourself or your teammates
- Become product minded
