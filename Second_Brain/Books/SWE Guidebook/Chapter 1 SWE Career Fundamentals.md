## Key Take Aways:

1. Own your own career - set goals, share your work/success, and try to get feedback
2. Be seen as someone who gets things done - when you make impact try to measure the business impact and share it
3. Keep a work log - record key work each week including important code changes, code reviews, design documents, discussion, planning, helping out others, postmortems, and anything else which takes time and has impact.
4. Understand the team's/manager's goals - ask them what are the biggest challenges the team/manager are facing in the coming weeks/months - there may be opportunities for you to help
5. Figure out what is important to your team, what is rewarded? How is impact measured?
6. Ask manager/tenured teammates about teams goals & how they align with the company's goals
7. Ask key-role people with influence about the team's/company's goals - could be product manager, skip manager, or business stakeholders
8. Figure out how performance reviews work and how to get the most out of them, ask mentors about it maxing it
9. In addition to work logs, record your wins - if you successful complete something record it and also screenshot positive feedback related to it
10. Share your progress from worklogs/wins to your manager in 1:1s because they often do not hear all the work you do
11. Help others, do code reviews, pair programming, or help unblock people when you have power to do so - make a teams calendar event to help capture you helping other or capture messages
12. Ask for feedback a good amount of time before performance reviews so you have time to improve on any area you are lacking
13. Ask for feedback about how you did and how you can improve for the following events: facilitating meeting, leading project, reviewing code (too harsh or not specific), resolving an outage, proposing a new initiative
