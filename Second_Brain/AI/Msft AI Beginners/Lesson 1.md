In AI what is symbolic reasoning?
Back: Where we try to create AGI by modeling human reasoning or the rules in people's heads that they use for decision making processes.

For example, when a doctor is diagnosing a patient, he or she may realize that a person has a fever, and thus there might be some inflammation going on inside the body. By applying a large set of rules to a specific problem a doctor may be able to come up with the final diagnosis.
