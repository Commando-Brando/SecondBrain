What is Linear Regression?
Back: Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. 

Example:
Predicting house prices based on square footage could use a linear regression model, where the equation might look like `Price = 50000 + 200 * SquareFootage` where 50,000 is the y intercept baseline and 200 is the slope. Here one feature is used but multiple can be used.
