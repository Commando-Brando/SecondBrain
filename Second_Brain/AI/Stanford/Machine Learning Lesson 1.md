Basic
What is reinforcement learning?
Back: Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment and learning to achieve a goal by receiving rewards or penalties for the actions it takes. Over time, the agent learns to take actions that maximize the total reward. It is important to note a model in of this type takes multiple decisions sequential so an example would be an AI robot learning how to walk.

In supervised learning what is the difference between classification and regression labels?
Back: Regression labels are those that are discrete numerical.
Classification labels are those where it is a non-numerical outcome like maybe the output is yes or no.

For example when training an AI model around real estate you could train a model using regression
labels to predict pricing or you can use classification labels to determine the type of house

What is Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)?
Back: A type of machine learning model which groups documents semantically based on the tokens in the document.
