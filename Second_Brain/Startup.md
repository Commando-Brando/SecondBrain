#### 10 Questions to Validate your Idea
- Does your idea have [founder-market fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th8JoIan4dg&t=447s)? aka are the founders the right people for the job
- How big is the market for the idea? (Need a big market) There are 2 kinds of markets, ones that are big now and ones that are small but rapidly growing
- How acute is the problem? Do people actually care about the problem?
- Do you have competition? Most founders assume competition is bad but that's not true
- Do you want this?
- Did this only recent become possible or necessary? Ne technology or regulatory change may introduce opportunities
- Is this an idea you would want to work on for years?
- Is this a scalable business?

Three things that seem bad but are good
- Ideas that are hard to get started
- Ideas that are in a boring space
- Ideas that have competitors

## Ways to generate Ideas

- Generate ideas in gaps you have seen:
	- Think of every job you have ever had (internships + life experiences)
	- What problems and opportunities are you in a special position to see?

- Think of things you just wish exists
	- Example door dash founders just really wished they could get food delivered to them
- Look at things in the world that changed recently which could create opportunity
	- For example, Covid pushed everyone indoors so maybe create something to make people more social
- Look for new variants on existing successful companies
- Go and talk to people and ask them what problems they have
