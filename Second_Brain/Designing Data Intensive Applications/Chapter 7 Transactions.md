What does ACID stand for?
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability

In ACID what is the A mean and describe?
(Atomicity)
The guarantee that if something goes wrong when executing SQL commands within a transaction that it can be aborted and any changes already executed in that transaction will be rolled back

In ACID what is the C mean and describe?
(Consistency)
consistency refers to an application-specific notion of the database being in a â€œgood state. which is not a guarantee the database makes but one that is up to the application

In ACID what is the I mean and describe?
(Isolation)
ensures that transactions are processed independently and changes made in one transaction are not visible to other transactions until that transaction is committed.


In ACID what is the D mean and describe?
(Durability)
the promise that once a transaction has committed successfully, any data it has written will not be forgotten, even if there is a hardware fault or the database crashes.
- single node databases it means data is written to disk and write ahead log for recovery 
- multi-node database means usually some number of nodes have been written to

What is a multi-object transaction?
Modifying several different objects (rows, documents, records) in a transaction
- statements in transaction differentiated between clients usually by TCP connection

In ACID what is weak isolation?
Traditional isolation for transaction can be costly performance-wise so a lot of databases use weak isolation which loosens the rules which increases performance but also increases the chances for transaction faults

What is ACID read-committed isolation?
The most basic level of transaction isolation is read committed.v It makes two guarantees:
1. When reading from the database, you will only see data that has been committed
(no dirty reads).
2. When writing to the database, you will only overwrite data that has been committed
(no dirty writes).

What is ACID snapshot isolation?
(AKA Repeatable Read Isolation)
Snapshot isolation is a concurrency control method in databases, ensuring that all reads made in a transaction will see a consistent snapshot of the database as it was at the beginning of the transaction, thereby satisfying the Isolation property of the ACID principles without locking data.
- writes not block by reads - reads not blocked by writes
