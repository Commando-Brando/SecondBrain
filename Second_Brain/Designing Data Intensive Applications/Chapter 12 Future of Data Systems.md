The Future of Data Systems  
If a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation  
of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end, the preservation of the ship  
entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz. to navigation.  
(Often quoted as: If the highest aim of a captain was the preserve his ship, he would keep it  
in port forever.)  
—St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica (1265–1274)
