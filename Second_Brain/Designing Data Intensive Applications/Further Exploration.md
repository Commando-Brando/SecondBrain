### Topics that are worth investigating further

- Elastic Search
- Kafka Grafana
- Cache invalidation/Updating 
- Can I use chatgpt to produce mermaid diagrams
- Sequential writes vs random writes and why sequential is faster?
	- Sequential writes a much better on hard disks because the mechanical nature of the disk requires the head to jump around to do random writes incurring significant overhead.
	- Even on SSDs there are issues because random writes shorten the lifespan compared to sequential
- Page 99 talks about memory bandwidth in relation to CPU
- What is Hadoop
