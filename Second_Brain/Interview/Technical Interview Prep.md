**General Leetcode Strategy:**

- the best way to study data structures & algorithms for interviewing is doing a set amount of leetcodes every week and learning new concepts, to achieve this I recommend learning a data structure and then spending 1-2 weeks completing easy to medium to hard problems for that data structure at a rate of anywhere from 1-3 problems a day to 4 a week depending on your goals and timeframe. For internships I would mostly focus on easy/medium questions
- Start practicing now!
- Also do it in Python, any other language is making it hard for yourself
